    This table mainly describes the change trend of the proportion of people over 65 years old in the total population of Japan, 
Sweden and the United States from 1940 to now, as well as the prediction from today to 2040.
    On the whole, the aging degree of the three countries has significantly increased. Among them, Japan is the lowest, 
and Sweden beyond the United States to become the highest around 2000.Since 1940, (due to the appearance of the post-war baby boom, 
the degree of aging in )Japan had slowly declined to between 3% and 4%, and had remained stable (since 1960 until around 1990.)from 1960 to around 1990.
(Subsequently, affected by the Plaza Accord and the economic bubbles,) the aging percentage changed dramatically, 
from 3.5% to about 10% from 1990 to today.
    During 1940 to 1980, the aging process in the United States had been intensifying, rising rapidly from 9% to about 15%. (With the 
increase of social welfare and the number of immigrants, )the aging population in the United States has remained unchanged.
Sweden has been rising since 1940, from about 7% to nearly 20%.

country who has the most aging population, reaching 25% or even higher. The United States and Sweden will gradually approach 25%, too.
